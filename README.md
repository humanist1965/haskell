# Haskell Experiments

My Experiments in haskell land.

I'm a functional programming fan: Have been using clojure as my main language for about 5 years until 2024.
Moved to typescript for work reasons but using it in a functional way.
I am really starting to like the typing-system so thought it time to try Haskell again.
