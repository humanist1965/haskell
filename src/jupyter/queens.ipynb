    "* **Board Size (N):**\n",
    "    * The standard 8x8 board is a common starting point.\n",
    "    * For programmers, larger boards (9x9, 10x10, 11x11, ..., 27x27) increase the challenge significantly.\n",

    "    * Currently, finding \\*all\\* solutions has been achieved up to the 27x27 board.\n",
    "    * Boards larger than 27x27 may require computational advancements like quantum computing to find all solutions.\n",
    "    * Finding a \\*single\\* solution is possible for much larger values of N (N = 1,000,000 and beyond).\n",
    "* **Solution Requirements:**\n",
    "    * **Finding all solutions:** This is the most complex task.\n",
    "    * **Finding all unique solutions:** This requires additional considerations to avoid counting symmetrical arrangements multiple times.\n",
    "    * **Finding a single solution:** This is the least complex, relatively speaking, and can be done for very large boards.\n",
