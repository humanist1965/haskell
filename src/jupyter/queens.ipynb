    "## The Queens Chessboard Puzzle: A Programmer's Playground\n",
    "\n",
    "The classic **Queens Chessboard Puzzle** is a timeless challenge that has intrigued computer programmers for years. This problem not only tests logical thinking and problem-solving skills but also offers a fantastic opportunity to explore algorithmic design.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this interactive notebook, we'll dive into the puzzleâ€™s complexities, exploring different approaches to solving it. Our programming language of choice will be **Haskell**, which offers unique features for efficient and elegant problem-solving.\n",
